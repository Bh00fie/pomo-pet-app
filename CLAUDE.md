# Project Context

## Status: PLANNING ONLY — no code has been written yet

This repo currently contains planning documents only. Do not scaffold the Expo project or write
app code until the user explicitly says to start building — see `docs/PLAN.md` for the agreed
sequence.

## What this is

An iOS Pomodoro timer app where completed focus sessions earn the user "fish" that grow and merge
into bigger fish, building a personal zoo/aquarium. Leaving a session early penalizes the pet
(Forest-style accountability). Monetized via IAP species/biome unlocks.

App name is a placeholder ("Pomo Pet") — rename throughout once a real name is chosen.

## Key docs

- `docs/MVP.md` — what's actually in scope for v1, and the definition of done
- `docs/PLAN.md` — step-by-step build sequence, from account setup to App Store launch
- `docs/FUTURE_FEATURES.md` — everything else discussed (leaderboards, Health integration, Watch
  app, alternate app ideas) — parked until after MVP ships

## Decided constraints

- iOS only for v1 (Android later is easy via Expo if it comes to that)
- React Native + Expo, EAS Build/Submit — no native Xcode GUI workflow needed for builds
- No custom backend for MVP — Game Center (free, built-in) covers leaderboards later instead of
  building a server
- Local-only data persistence for MVP (Zustand + AsyncStorage, versioned schema from day one)
- **Build order is free-first**: the entire MVP (M0–M6a in `docs/PLAN.md`) is built and demoed via
  App Store Expo Go with zero Apple Developer spend. The $99/yr enrollment happens only after the
  user has used the finished free build and decided they like it — do not suggest enrolling earlier
- **Expo SDK pinned to ~54.x, do not upgrade.** The App Store build of Expo Go only supports SDK
  54; anything newer requires a paid-account dev client and breaks the free-testing plan
- Animation stack: **Reanimated 4 + Skia** (both ship inside Expo Go). Explicitly not Lottie/Rive
  (need a dev client) and not Moti (incompatible with Reanimated 4 on this SDK)
- IAP is built against a `MockEntitlementProvider` for the whole free phase; swapped for
  RevenueCat only in M6b, after enrollment
- Growth vs. merge: sessions grow a fish's XP *within* its current stage; merging N same-stage
  fish is the only way to *cross* a stage boundary

## Tooling reference

https://github.com/rohitg00/awesome-claude-code-toolkit — curated list of Claude Code
plugins/agents/skills. The marketplace is registered locally (`claude plugin marketplace add
rohitg00/awesome-claude-code-toolkit`, marketplace id `claude-code-toolkit`), but as of 2026-08-02
its plugins (`react-native-dev`, `ios-developer`, and others — checked several) cannot actually be
installed: every `plugin.json` in the repo declares a `commands` array field that the current
Claude Code plugin schema rejects (commands are supposed to be auto-discovered from a `commands/`
directory instead, per Anthropic's own official plugin manifests, which omit that field entirely).
This is a manifest bug upstream in that repo, not fixable locally short of patching their source.

Workaround until upstream fixes it: the actual command files are still present locally under
`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-code-toolkit/plugins/{react-native-dev,ios-developer}/commands/`
and can be read directly for reference/inspiration when implementation starts, even though they
aren't usable as installed slash commands.

Separately, https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill is installed and working
(`ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill`) — design-system generation (styles, palettes, font pairings)
that activates automatically once real UI code is being written.
